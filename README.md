# Don't READ ME.

## Outcome has two types game and dead

- game means the Option leads to more game content
- dead is a dead end it can mean a fail or a win

## every time an Option leads to an Outcome type game it sets nowGame to the Outcome and preGame to the previous game (for returning)

# the problem of an outcome without a display not throwing the customized error on line 51 but throwing a stupid cant read property of undefined error instead hasnt been solved. no no no i hate you.
