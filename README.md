# Don't READ ME.

## Outcome has two types game and dead

- game means the Option leads to more game content
- dead is a dead end it can mean a fail or a win

## every time an Option leads to an Outcome type game it sets nowGame to the Outcome and preGame to the previous game (for returning)

### but there might be some probs...

# ive a huge problem dude. the game keeps loading and its never gonna stop. we cant let the outcome initialize until its needed. or itll never stop like a dead loop!
